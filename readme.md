# Tyrion color scheme for Sublime

This is a revised version of Carl Calderon's [Tyrann Alex color scheme](https://github.com/carlcalderon/sublime-color-schemes). It includes:

- Softer colors, influenced by Notepad++'s Bespin theme.
- When paired with the [MarkdownEditing package](https://github.com/ttscoff/MarkdownEditing), it has Markdown highlighting inspired by the [DobDark theme](https://github.com/charlesroper/DobDark-Theme).

If you make it even easier on the eyes please let me know with a tweet or a pull request.
